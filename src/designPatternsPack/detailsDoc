// Factory Design Pattern //

Imagine you love playing with toy cars. 
Sometimes you want a red car, and sometimes you want a blue car. 
But instead of going to the toy store each time to buy a new car, 
your mom gives you a "Car Factory".

The Car Factory is a special machine that can make any kind of car you want, 
just by telling it what color you want.

This is like the Factory pattern in Java! 
Instead of going to the store to get a new object each time, 
we have a special "Factory" that can make any kind of object we want, 
just by telling it what we want.

//  Builder Design Pattern  //
Instead of trying to create an object directly, 
we have a special "Builder" class that helps us build the object exactly the way we want it.
